# Welcome to Priya Jetley's GitHub Page

I'm a seasoned software development professional with over 20 years of experience leading complex, high-visibility cloud-based projects using Oracle APEX and Oracle Autonomous Database for strategic stakeholders. As a certified Scrum Master and Product Owner, I excel at delivering innovative solutions through:

-   Technical proficiency: Full-stack development, database design, and front-end development.
-   Project management: Agile methodologies, stakeholder engagement.
-   Leadership: Team building, mentorship, and fostering a collaborative culture.
-   Communication: Effective communication of complex technical concepts to both technical and non-technical audiences.

I'm passionate about problem-solving, and my mantra is that the most complex problems are often solved by the simplest, most elegant solutions.
